# Webdriver Containers

Test Containers can be used to automatically instantiate and manage containers that include web browsers, such as those
from SeleniumHQ's [docker-selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium) project.

## Benefits

* Fully compatible with Selenium 2/Webdriver tests, by providing a `RemoteWebDriver` instance
* No need to have specific web browsers, or even a desktop environment, installed on test servers. The only dependency
  is a working Docker installation and your Java JUnit test suite.
* Browsers are always launched from a fixed, clean image. This means no configuration drift from user changes or
  automatic browser upgrades.
* Compatibility between browser version and the Selenium API is assured: a compatible version of the browser docker
  images will be automatically selected to match the version of `selenium-api-*.jar` on the classpath
* Additionally the use of a clean browser prevents leakage of cookies, cached data or other state between tests.
* **VNC screen recording**: Test Containers can automatically record video of test runs (optionally capturing just
  failing tests)

Creation of browser containers is fast, so it's actually quite feasible to have a totally fresh browser instance for
every test.

## Example

The following field in your JUnit UI test class will prepare a container running Chrome:
```java
@Rule
public BrowserWebDriverContainer chrome =
    new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
            .withDesiredCapabilities(DesiredCapabilities.chrome());
```
        
Now, instead of instantiating an instance of WebDriver directly, use the following to obtain an instance inside your
test methods:
```java
RemoteWebDriver driver = chrome.getWebDriver();
```

You can then use this driver instance like a regular WebDriver.

Note that, if you want to test a **web application running on the host machine** (the machine the JUnit tests are
running on - which is quite likely), you'll need to replace any references to `localhost` with an IP address that the
Docker container can reach. Use the `getHostIpAddress()` method, e.g.:
```java
driver.get("http://" + chrome.getHostIpAddress() + ":8080/");
```

## Options

### Other browsers

At the moment, Chrome and Firefox are supported. To switch, simply change the first parameter to the rule constructor:
```java
new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
                .withDesiredCapabilities(DesiredCapabilities.chrome());
```
        
or
```java
new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
                .withDesiredCapabilities(DesiredCapabilities.firefox());
```

### Recording videos

By default, no videos will be recorded. However, you can instruct Test Containers to capture videos for all tests or
just for failing tests.

To do this, simply add extra parameters to the rule constructor:
```java
new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
                .withDesiredCapabilities(DesiredCapabilities.chrome())
                .withRecordingMode(VncRecordingMode.RECORD_ALL, new File("./target/"))
```

or if you only want videos for test failures:
```java
new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
                .withDesiredCapabilities(DesiredCapabilities.chrome())
                .withRecordingMode(VncRecordingMode.RECORD_FAILING, new File("./target/"))
```
Note that the seconds parameter to `withRecordingMode` should be a directory where recordings can be saved.

If you would like to customise the file name of the recording, or provide a different directory at runtime based on the description of the test and/or its success or failure, you may provide a custom recording file factory as follows:
```java
new BrowserWebDriverContainer()
                //...
                .withRecordingFileFactory(new CustomRecordingFileFactory())
```

Note the factory must implement `org.testcontainers.containers.RecordingFileFactory`.
